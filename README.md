Source files for the article on [Marcofolio.net](https://www.marcofolio.net/) called "[*Colorful Geometric Background using Xamarin.Forms Shapes*](https://marcofolio.net/geometric-xamarin-forms-shapes/)". The demo uses [Xamarin.Forms Shapes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/shapes/) and is inspired by [SpoonGraphics](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-create-a-colourful-geometric-pattern-in-illustrator). De demo works on iOS and Android due to using Xamarin.Forms.
